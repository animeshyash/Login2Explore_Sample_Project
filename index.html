                <p class="sectag bigtext">WHAT ARE ANIMAL RIGHTS?</p>
                <p class="secsubtag smalltext">Animal rights are moral principles grounded in the belief that non-human
                    animals deserve the ability to live as they wish, without being subjected to the desires of human
                    beings. At the core of animal rights is autonomy, which is another way of saying choice. In many
                    countries, human rights are enshrined to protect certain freedoms, such as the right to expression,
                    freedom from torture, and access to democracy. Of course, these choices are constrained depending on
                    social locations like race, class, and gender, but generally speaking, human rights safeguard the basic
                    tenets of what makes human lives worth living. Animal rights aim to do something similar, only for
                    non-human animals.</p>

                <p class="sectag bigtext">Why is animal welfare important?</p>
                <p class="secsubtag smalltext">Animal welfare is important because there are so many animals around the
                    world suffering from being used for entertainment, food, medicine, fashion, scientific advancement, and
                    as exotic pets. Every animal deserves to have a good life where they enjoy the benefits of the Five
                    Domains.</p>

                <p class="secsubtag smalltext">Animal rights philosophy is based on the idea that animals should not be used
                    by people for any reason, and that animal rights should protect their interests the way human rights
                    protect people. Animal welfare, on the other hand, is a set of practices designed to govern the
                    treatment of animals who are being dominated by humans, whether for food, research, or entertainment.

                <p class="secsubtag smalltext">Scientists believe that the world is undergoing a mass extinction event,
                    driven by human activity. Since 1900, an estimated 543 species of vertebrates have gone extinct,
                    although the number could be much higher. Species such as the northern hairy-nosed wombat, the Javan
                    rhino, and the tamaraw buffalo are under critical threat of extinction, with some populations numbering
                    less than 500 individuals each. A study conducted in 2020 predicts that one-fifth of all species would
                    be threatened with extinction by the middle of the century. </p>

                <p class="secsubtag smalltext">World Animal Protection has a multi-pronged approach to improving the lives
                    of animals. Our programs include protecting animals in the wild and creating a better quality of life
                    for animals in farming. Around the world, we work with corporations to implement robust animal welfare
                    policies ending the use of wild animals for entertainment and the exotic pet trade. We also encourage
                    people to reduce the amount of cruelly produced factory-farmed meat they eat and work with meat
                    suppliers to implement higher animal welfare practices, eliminating some of the worst cruelties farmed
                    animals face today.</p>
